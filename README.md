This is a computer implementation of the game [Teeko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teeko).

Right now the graphics are bad and the computer's gameplay is not very good.

The easiest way to run the game is to clone the repo into your QuickLisp load path and run:

``` common-lisp
CL-USER> (ql:quickload :teeko)
To load "teeko":
  Load 1 ASDF system:
    teeko
; Loading "teeko"

(:TEEKO)
CL-USER>  (teeko:main)
```
